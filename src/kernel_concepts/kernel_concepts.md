# Kernel concepts

This chapter begins with a high level road map, which everyone should read, then covers some ideas needed to understand the kernel's nuts and bolts, and is less focused on theory. The ideas in the later sections do not need to be completely understood up-front, so readers should feel free to skim them and come back as needed.
